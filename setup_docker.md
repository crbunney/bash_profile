I've just been using Docker Desktop, so download and install that from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ (noting the licensing requirements, hasn't been an issue so far)

old notes

* brew install --cask docker
* brew install docker-compose docker-engine
* also --cask virtualbox

* Just install brew --cask docker (Do you need anything else if you do that?)
* softwareupdate --install-rosetta
